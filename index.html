                    <h2>Enhancing Digital Accessibility in My Bootcamp Project</h2>
                    <p>A WCAG-informed review of my final Makers bootcamp project, focusing on accessibility improvements.</p>
                    
                        <h3>What Worked Well</h3>
        <p>During my review, I identified several strengths in the project's accessibility:</p>
        <div class="explanation">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strong Color Contrast:</strong> The main content met WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.3 (Contrast Minimum), ensuring readability for users with visual impairments.</li>
            <li><strong>Logical Navigation Flow:</strong> The intuitive navigation supported WCAG 2.1 Principle 2 (Operable), making it easier for users to interact with the content.</li>
            <li><strong>Properly Labelled Links:</strong> Most links were descriptive, meeting WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.4.4 (Link Purpose in Context).</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
    

    
        <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
        <p>I also identified key areas that needed enhancement to meet WCAG standards:</p>
        <div class="explanation">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Descriptive Page Titles:</strong> The page title needed to be more descriptive to comply with WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.4.2 (Page Titled).</li>
            <li><strong>Missing ARIA Labels:</strong> Adding ARIA labels for images and interactive elements would meet WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.1.1 (Non-text Content).</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Heading Structure:</strong> Refining the heading structure aligned with WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships).</li>
            <li><strong>Clearer Visual Focus Indicators:</strong> Enhancing focus indicators supported WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.4.7 (Focus Visible).</li>
            <li><strong>Responsive Design Tweaks:</strong> Adjustments ensured the design remained usable at 250%+ zoom, meeting WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.10 (Reflow).</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
   

    
        <h3>Actions Taken</h3>
        <p>Instead of trying to take on a complete overhaul I kept it focused and targeted the most impactful improvements</p>
        <div class="explanation">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simplified Navigation:</strong> Removed redundant dropdown menus to streamline navigation, aligning with WCAG 2.1 Principle 2 (Operable).</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Form Accessibility:</strong> Added <code>aria-describedby</code> and <code>aria-live</code> attributes to forms, complying with WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 3.3.1 (Error Identification).</li>
            <li><strong>Color Contrast Updates:</strong> Adjusted the red accent color to meet WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.3 (Contrast Minimum).</li>
            <li><strong>Testing with Assistive Technology:</strong> Used NVDA to identify and clean up over-labeled elements and unnecessary HTML attributes, aligning with WCAG 2.1 Principle 1 (Perceivable).</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
    

    
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <p>This process reinforced several important lessons:</p>
        <div class="explanation">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accessibility is Integral:</strong> Building accessibility into the design process from the start saves time and creates a better experience for all users.</li>
            <li><strong>Testing is Crucial:</strong> Testing with assistive technology revealed practical issues that automated tools might miss.</li>
            <li><strong>Small Changes, Big Impact:</strong> Simple updates, like improving page titles and adding ARIA labels, significantly enhanced accessibility.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By applying WCAG principles and success criteria, I was able to make my project more inclusive and user-friendly. This experience reinforced the importance of accessibility in digital design and inspired me to continue building inclusive experiences.</p>
        <p>I am currently deploying this project to show the difference between the two and will upload as soon as its live</p>
